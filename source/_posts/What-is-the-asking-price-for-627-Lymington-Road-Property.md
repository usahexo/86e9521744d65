#  What amenities come included with the property?

When you purchase a property, you will want to know what amenities come included with it. This will help you determine if the property is right for you. The following are some of the most common amenities that come with a property:

- Parking: This may be a designated spot in a parking lot or garage, or it may be on-street parking.

- Yard space: Some properties include a yard, while others do not. If you have children or pets, you will want to make sure there is adequate yard space for them to play in.

- Storage: A property may include storage space in the form of a closet, attic, or basement. This can be helpful if you need to store extra belongings.

- Pets: Not all properties allow pets, so be sure to check this before purchasing one. If you do have pets, make sure the property has enough space for them to roam around and/or a fenced-in area for them to play in.

- Laundry facilities: Many properties include laundry facilities on site, which can save you time and money since you won't have to go to a laundromat.

- Gym: A gym membership can be expensive, so if the property you're interested in includes a gym, that can be a plus.

- Swimming pool: A swimming pool can provide hours of entertainment for both children and adults. It's definitely something to consider if the property includes one.

#  What size is the property in square footage?

This is an important question to ask when you are looking for a new home. If you have a family, you will need enough room for everyone to live comfortably. You will also want plenty of space to store your belongings.

The size of the property can vary significantly from one city to the next. For example, in New York City, the average apartment is less than 500 square feet. In contrast, in Phoenix, Arizona, the average home is more than 2,000 square feet.

Before you start your search for a new home, you should decide what size is right for you. Are you looking for something small and compact or do you want plenty of space to spread out? Once you know what you are looking for, it will be much easier to find the perfect property.

#  Is the property furnished or unfurnished?

When you are looking for a new place to live, one of the first questions you'll need to ask yourself is whether you want a furnished or unfurnished property. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know which one is right for you before you start your search.

If you decide that a furnished property is right for you, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, make sure that the furniture is in good condition â€“ you don't want to move in and then have to spend money fixing up everything. Secondly, check that the furniture is appropriate for your needs. If you're planning on hosting dinner parties or having friends round for drinks, for example, you'll need a table and chairs!

If you choose an unfurnished property instead, you'll need to furnish it yourself. This can be a great way to personalise your home and save money on the rent, but it can also be more work than furnished properties. You'll need to budget for furniture, appliances and accessories, and make sure that everything fits together well.

So, what's the best option for you? It really depends on your lifestyle and needs. If you're not sure, why not try both? Furnished properties are great if you want to move in quickly without having to worry about buying furniture, while unfurnished properties are perfect if you want to customise your home exactly how you want it.

#  What type of heating system is installed in the property?

A heating system is a network of tubes that deliver hot water or steam to heat a property. It can be gas, oil or electric.

The most common type of heating system in the UK is gas central heating. This is a system where the boiler heats water, which then circulates through the radiators in the property to provide warmth.

Oil central heating is also common, and works in a similar way to gas central heating but uses oil as the fuel source.

Electric central heating is less common, but does have some benefits - it's usually cheaper to run than gas or oil systems, and there are no emissions so it's good for the environment. However, it can be more expensive to install initially.
